# Student-Management-System-Using-C
This C program manages student examination records using structures and arrays. Faculty can add student details, enter marks for five subjects, calculate totals, percentages, and grades, display individual results, sort students by performance, search by name, and persist data with file handling. It’s menu-driven, validated, and efficient.
